## 🚀 Project Overview

This static portfolio site serves as a personal landing page that introduces me, displays my projects, and allows visitors to contact me. The site is divided into four major sections:

- 🏠 **Home** — Introduction and welcome message  
- 🙋‍♀️ **About** — A brief about who I am and what I do  
- 🛠️ **Projects** — A section displaying mini-projects or accomplishments  
- ✉️ **Contact** — A simple contact page or message form  

Each page is connected and designed to be **minimal, readable, and aesthetic**.
